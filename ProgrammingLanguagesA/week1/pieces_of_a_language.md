1. Syntax: How do you write language constructs?

2. Semantics: What do programs mean? (Evaluation rules)

3. Idioms: What are typical patterns for using language features to express your computation?

4. Libraries: What facilities does the language (or a well-known project) provide "standard"? (E.g. file access, data structures)

5. Tools: What do language implementations provide to make your job easier? (E.g. REPL, debugger, code formatter,...) Not actually part of the language
